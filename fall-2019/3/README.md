# Real-time object detection on Mobile networks
## Mariem Loukil
In this prject we are trying to perform real-time object detection on Deep Learning networks that can be deployed on Mobile and Edge devices. 
We trained three different networks on our specific dataset (IndyCar images data). The networks are : 
* SSD-Mobilenetv1
* SSD-Mobilenetv2 
* Tiny Yolov3
