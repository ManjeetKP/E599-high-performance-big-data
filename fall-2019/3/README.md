# Real-time object detection on Mobile networks
## Mariem Loukil
The aim of this project is to perform real-time object detection
on IndyCar images and videos using object detection models that
could be deployed on mobile and edge devices. In this work, we
compare different models and architectures (SSD-Mobilenet-v1,
SSD-Mobilenet-v2 and Tiny-Yolov3) to see which gives the best
accuracy and performance in the context of our given problem (on
CPU and GPU)
